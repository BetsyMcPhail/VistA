   /CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/CPRS%20VERSION%2029/OR_30_306_SRC_scrubbed.zip

contained three files that were released under the 1.1 version of the
Mozilla Public license:

  "Wcrypt2.pas", "WinSCard.pas", and "XlfMime.pas".

The license for these files is not compatible with the license of this
repository and cannot be distributed within it.  These files have been
separated into a different repository and can be acquired by
either downloading or cloning from the following webpage:

   https://github.com/OSEHRA-Sandbox/CPRSv29-XUDigSig

OSEHRA has generated a new set of these files which are found in:

  Packages/Order Entry Results Reporting/CPRS/CPRS-Chart/XuDigSig/

To utilize the original versions, acquire them from the above resource and
set the CMake variable BUILD_DELPHI_XuDigSig_DIR to be the path to that directory.
